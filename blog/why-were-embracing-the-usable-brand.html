                    When we founded Flowcore, we were solving a specific technical problem: how to build event-driven data infrastructure that could handle enterprise-scale requirements. But over the past year, something profound shifted in how we think about the problem we're solving—and that shift led us to rebrand as Usable.

                    <p>When we founded Flowcore, we were solving a specific technical problem: how to build event-driven data infrastructure that could handle enterprise-scale requirements. We succeeded. Our platform powers real-world systems managing critical data flows for customers across sectors.</p>
                    
                    <p>But over the past year, something profound shifted in how we think about the problem we're solving.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="article-section u-animate-on-scroll u-fade-in-up">
                    <h2>The AI Agent Problem</h2>
                    <p>We started noticing a pattern as organizations began deploying AI agents: <strong>AI agents are terrible at knowledge management</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Teams building AI agents face a fundamental choice: build their own RAG infrastructure—requiring decisions on vector databases, embedding models, chunking strategies, re-rankers, and multi-agent orchestration—or settle for agents with no long-term memory at all.</p>
                    
                    <p>This isn't a technical limitation of the AI models themselves. It's a knowledge infrastructure problem. Every agent conversation starts from zero because there's no shared memory layer.</p>
                    
                    <p>We realized that the most valuable thing we could build wasn't just a data infrastructure platform—it was a dedicated knowledge base for AI agents. We built <strong>Usable</strong> on top of our Flowcore infrastructure to solve exactly this: providing AI agents with structured, long-term memory that persists across conversations and sessions.</p>
                    
                    <p>And that's when it became clear: the name "Flowcore" didn't capture what we were really doing anymore.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="article-section u-animate-on-scroll u-fade-in-up">
                    <h2>Why "Usable"?</h2>
                    <p>The name reflects a fundamental shift in how we think about enterprise knowledge in the AI era.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Usable</strong> means:</p>
                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li><strong>Knowledge that's structured for AI</strong>: Not document archives, but interconnected fragments with types, tags, and relationships that create a knowledge graph agents can navigate</li>
                        <li><strong>Upload once, connect any agent</strong>: Teams upload their documents, code, notes, and internal knowledge—through drag-and-drop, fully editable interfaces, or by connecting to any legacy system via API to keep knowledge up-to-date automatically</li>
                        <li><strong>Agentic search with re-ranking</strong>: AI agents connect via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) or REST API to perform intelligent search that understands context and relevance</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared memory infrastructure</strong>: Multiple agents across an organization access the same durable, cross-session knowledge rather than each starting from zero</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>We're not just storing data anymore. We're providing the infrastructure layer that makes AI agent knowledge management possible—without requiring teams to build custom RAG systems or invest months in ML engineering.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="article-section u-animate-on-scroll u-fade-in-up">
                    <h2>What Changes (and What Doesn't)</h2>
                    <p><strong>For our customers</strong>: Nothing changes operationally. All contracts, support relationships, and service levels remain exactly the same. We're still the same team, with the same commitment to your success. The only updates are our legal entity name (Usable Sp/f) and our primary domain (usable.dev). If you're using Flowcore, we'll continue supporting it as a standalone product—it's still the powerful event infrastructure you depend on.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>For our mission</strong>: Everything changes. We're now explicitly focused on knowledge management for AI agents. Every product decision, every feature, every partnership will be evaluated through this lens: <em>Does this make knowledge more accessible and usable for AI agents?</em></p>

                    <h2>The Strategic Partnership with Random Ventures</h2>
                    <p>Today, we're also announcing that <strong>Peter Vesterbacka</strong> and <strong>Kustaa Valtonen</strong> from <strong>Random Ventures</strong> have joined us as strategic advisors and investors.</p>

                    </figure>
                    
                    <p>Peter is best known for his work with Rovio the Angry Birds company where he was the Mighty Eagle (CMO). He is also well known as the founder of <strong>Slush</strong>, the world's leading startup event. He brings extensive experience in building global tech ecosystems, scaling startups, and connecting founders with international markets. But more importantly, he understands the problem we're solving. He's seen how AI is reshaping how companies operate, and he believes in our approach to organizational memory.</p>
                    
                    <p>Kustaa is a seasoned early-stage investor and technology advisor with deep experience in enterprise software and B2B SaaS. Through Random Ventures, he works closely with founders to scale products and organizations internationally. Random Ventures is a Finest Bay Area investment company that invests globally in early-stage startups, supporting ambitious founders with both capital and hands-on strategic guidance across markets.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their involvement isn't just capital—it's strategic guidance, networks, and validation that we're solving a real problem at scale.</p>

                    <h2>Where We Go from Here</h2>
                    <p>We're at an inflection point. Everyone is building AI agents, and most are struggling with knowledge management. Usable provides the infrastructure layer that makes this possible—without requiring teams to build custom RAG systems, choose between dozens of technical options, or invest months in ML engineering.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're expanding beyond our current customer base. We're building partnerships with AI agent frameworks, observability platforms, and enterprise software vendors. And we're committed to making Usable the standard for AI agent knowledge management.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Faroe Islands have produced some remarkable technology companies. We intend to add Usable to that list—not just as a local success story, but as a global platform that reshapes how enterprises think about organizational knowledge.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thank you for being part of this journey.</p>
